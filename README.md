# TI-99-usb-keys
Teensy 3.1 sketch to translate usb keyboard to TI-99/4a 15 pin interface.

This project interfaces a Teensy 3.1 and a Circuits@Home USB Host shield, to take input from a USB keyboard, and simulate the matrix keyboard built into the TI. 

The USB keyboard can be used with the TI keyboard still in place. The user can switch between them at will.
